What is NetVirt?
----------------
NetVirt is a network virtualization platform (NVP).

NetVirt is well suited to create a Network as a service (NaaS) that
provides multi-tenant L2 network.

Cloud networks are similar to a virtual private network (VPN) because
they enable users to securely access files, printers, applications, etc.
from anywhere in the world, on any device. However, cloud networks are
multi-tenant private virtual cloud networks that overlay the Internet.
Each virtual cloud network functions like a borderless LAN and provides
fully switched, any-to-any connectivity between servers, PCs, and mobile
devices from anywhere. -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_networking
