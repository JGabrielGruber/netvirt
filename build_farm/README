What these scripts are for
--------------------------

These scripts are used to compile the NetVirt Agent from a pristine Debian machine.

Copy the script you want on the fresh Debian and run it. It will download
everything that is needed to compile the DynVPN client, install it, compile the
client and create the package, ready to be installed.

Prerequisites
-------------

The scripts must be run with administrative rights, in order to install build
dependencies.
